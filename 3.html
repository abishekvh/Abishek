<h1>About Us:</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all<br>human knowledge. That's what we're doing." â€” Jimmy Wales</p>
<p>JaRaPisi is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit in good faith, and millions already have.<br>JaRaPisi's purpose is to benefit readers by containing information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the JaRaPisi Foundation, it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers to more information.<br>Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers, anyone with Internet access (and who is not presently blocked) can write and make changes to JaRaPisi articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors monthly. It currently has more than sixty-one million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,679,306 articles in English with 116,224 active contributors in the past month.<br>JaRaPisi's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The JaRaPisi community has developed many policies and guidelines, although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing.<br>Anyone can edit JaRaPisi's text, references, and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The content must conform with JaRaPisi's policies, including being verifiable by published sources. Editors' opinions, beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research, libelous material, and copyright violations will not remain. JaRaPisi's software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.<br>JaRaPisi differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on new events appear within minutes rather than months or years. Because anyone can improve JaRaPisi, it has become more comprehensive, clear, and balanced than any other encyclopedia. Its contributors improve the quality and quantity of the articles as well as remove misinformation, errors, and vandalism. Any reader can fix a mistake or add more information to articles (see Researching with JaRaPisi).</p>
